sudo chgrp -R training workshop_shared


### Set up instances

cd /data
sudo chgrp training .
sudo chmod 775 .

/home/ubuntu/BerlinTrinityWorkshop2018/__setup/user_setup/init_users.py --num_users 25 --ip_addr 34.221.39.3  | tee cmds.txt

elastic ip: 54.200.153.6



### retain elastic IP addr in bashrc
export IPADDR=${elastic_ip} >> .bashrc 


### Create user workspaces

Here's where the magic of Docker comes in.  Instead of creating different unix users for workshop attendees, we'll just create separate workspace directories for each user, and then mount that workspace area in as the home directory of a user as running in a Docker container.  All communication of the user with the docker container will happen via a unique port assignment and easily accessed via the web browser.

Each student will have two Docker containers running:  1. for the Trinity workshop, involving an SSH terminal and an Apache webserver, and 2. for the single cell workshop, where all work will be done via Rstudio.

Every user will be assigned a numerical ID (eg. in the range 1..50) and ports will be assigned in the following ranges for each of the applications: gateone-SSH (9k), Apache (8k), and direct-ssh (10k).

We'll run the following to both create user directories and create commands that will be used for launching Docker containers.

    ~/BerlinTrinityWorkshop2017/__setup/user_setup/init_users.py \
        --num_users 15 \
	--ip_addr ${IPADDR} > cmds.list
	
The above will create directories:

    user_spaces/user_01
    user_spaces/user_02
    user_spaces/user_03
    user_spaces/user_04
    ...

and the cmds.list has the commands required to update permissions on these user directories and for launching the docker containers for the students:

    ex.  head -n4 cmds.list

    sudo chown -R training user_spaces
    sudo chgrp -R training user_spaces




Simply running 'sh cmds.list' would run through all the commands in that list.  Notice that the workspace for user with ID 1 is being set up in Docker has having the user_01/ area mounted as /home/training in the docker container, and that the various ports (8001, 9001, and 10001) are being mapped to the ports that each of the applications listen to in the docker container.



### Create a student landing page

On your main server (outside of Docker), be sure to install apache2:

    sudo apt-get  update && sudo apt-get install -y apache2


Run the following script to generate a web page that provides links for each student to their corresponding ssh, apache, and rstudio instances with proper port assignments.

You simply need a file 'attendees.list' that contains a single column with the names of the students as you want them to appear on the web page.


    ~/BerlinTrinityWorkshop2017/__setup/user_setup/attendee_list_to_html_table.py  \
        --ip_addr ${AWS_IP_ADDRESS} \
	--attendee_list attendees.list \
	> course_page.html

Further edit the course_page.html file to your liking, and then drop it into:

     sudo cp course_page.html /var/www/html/.

and then visit:

    http://${AWS_IP_ADDRESS}/course_page.html

to view the page in your web browser.

# Other Docker tidbits:

## Removing all docker containers:

If you want to remove all the student Docker containers, you can run the following script:

    ~/BerlinTrinityWorkshop2017/__setup/user_setup/remove_user_dockers.sh

which essentially runs 'docker stop' and 'docker rm' to first stop and then remove the docker container.

## Dealing with hang-ups

If the ssh-terminal or Rstudio ends up hanging for some reason, you can just restart that user's docker container.  Examine the port number in the student's web URL and then find that running docker instance:

    docker ps | grep $port_number

Get the 'CONTAINER ID' (ex. 1326d98012af)  and then restart it:

    docker restart 1326d98012af

This will immediately reset it and the student will carry on from where they left off.

## Running all of this on Amazon:

See this excellent documentation from Nico Delhomme [here on github](https://github.com/ekorpela/cloud-vm-workshop/blob/master/materials/NicolasDelhomme/using_docker_on_aws_for_bioinformatics_workshops-practical.pdf), which provides a walkthrough for setting up a system just like this on Amazon. You simply need to just set up your instance, and then follow the instructions above for further setup.  Get the IP address for your Amazon machine and use that in place of the http://binfservapp05.unibe.ch/ server.
